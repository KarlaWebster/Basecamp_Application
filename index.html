						<h6>Addressing Q1 & Q2 </h6>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>From 2004 – 2012 I worked in hospitality and customer service before taking my first office job with Bierman Autism Center. In my previous career, I’ve managed a restaurant, created latte art for foodie coffee consumers early in the morning, helped library patrons with their selections, organized volunteers for a political campaign, worked in a small wine shop and created interesting demonstrations for customers at an organic grocery store to encourage them to sample and purchase new products! <br/>    <p>&nbsp;</p>

Along the way, I thought that the ‘service’ jobs that I was working were stepping stones to an office job that would ultimately be my career. 
What I’ve discovered in the past 7 years with my company is that my <strong>favorite</strong> weeks on the job are those where I teach new skills to team members, host information sessions with teachers or other professionals, work our company booth at conferences and fundraisers OR assist employees with solving their inevitable technology problems. <br/>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
Upon reflection, I’ve realized that this means that I truly <strong>enjoy</strong> the process of solving problems and educating individuals or teams. I’m a naturally curious person, and I won’t stop until the questions are answered. What a revelation – <strong>I belong in customer service!</strong> I get MORE satisfaction from those little interactions than I do analyzing Adwords results or designing high converting landing pages. I am more fulfilled when I get feedback that I helped one person in a way that was significant to them than I do from CTR reports for successful FB ads. 
                        <br/>    <p>&nbsp;</p>

Fortunately, my current company started using Basecamp as a project management tool as we grew to multiple states around October 2014. We demoed Asana as well but the choice was clear, and we’ve been a Basecamp team ever since! I quickly became obsessed. I dove deep into the Signals and Noise blog. I ordered Rework and Remote and gave them out at work retreats. I host trainings for our teachers, SLP’s, direct service providers and other professionals to encourage them to collaborate more using Basecamp tools rather than e-mail. I occasionally peep the remote jobs at ReWorkRemotely. Finally, I took the plunge - I signed up to receive job alerts directly from Basecamp.  
The nicest thing about Basecamp for my current company is that (in the words of Don Draper) it’s SIMPLE but significant. Our team isn’t very traditionally tech savvy, and it’s refreshing to hear that of our ‘tech stack’ -  teams find Basecamp to be the easiest part to use and one of most beneficial thing to keep open throughout the day. 
                        <br/>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
Even though this is a little scary, I’m now applying to work for a company that I greatly admire for it’s absolute transparency, it’s determination to appeal to  and serve all types of customers and not just ‘techies’ and most importantly, it’s insistence to treat BOTH customers and employees like valued human beings. <br/>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
So even though I have a smidge of imposter syndrome (applying to work at a company that I revere!) I do think that the skills that I’ve developed over the last 15 years could be useful to this role, and that a support career <strong>at Basecamp</strong> could be a place that I’d absolutely thrive.<br/>    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>When I started with my current company, we had 30 employees under two roofs in Indiana and we had a miniscule tiny little marketing budget that I had to squeeze the most out of. The owner and CEO had a scrappy website they had built using Go Daddy’s website builder (lots of comic sans.) I bought a few books, watched some videos and immersed myself in the Boostrap library and built a new website for them in 2012. In 2016, I did it again and the current iteration can be seen <a href="https://www.biermanaba.com/" target="_blank" >here.</a><br/> <p>&nbsp;</p> We now have almost 250 employees in 4 states, but we still have a pretty scrappy ethos and a tiny little marketing budget. We make big things happen with the limited resources we have, so I’ve taught myself a lot of new skills over the years! </p>
                        
                        	<h6>Addressing Q3 </h6>
                <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>I flew to NYC recently on a fairly full flight, on one of those smaller planes with 3 seats x 2 seats instead of 3 x 3 seats. There were a few open seats in First Class and Business, but economy was completely booked. They made an announcement that it would be helpful if economy passengers could gate check their carry-on bags since there wouldn’t be enough overhead bin space, which I and several other customers graciously did. Once boarding, I ended up behind a man complaining loudly that they couldn’t ‘make him’ do anything since he’d paid for his seat and it came with a carry on. I ended up being seated next to that man, who tried to cram his bag underneath his seat to no avail. A stewardess had to take his bag for him and she ended up sending it down below as there wasn’t any space at all in the overheads. He was VERY upset and suggested that they should move him to an open seat in business OR at least bring him a round of free drinks for the inconvenience. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>She politely told him that wasn’t possible while wrestling with his bag. Every time she walked by, he reminded her that he wanted an upgrade or a freebie and that he needed more personal space, his behavior was just really over the top! Eventually she said she would see what she could do. I just dug deeper into my book and grimaced. It’s a privilege that I am able to travel and I would be seeing my first Broadway show that night! Upon her return, the man got his remaining items together, expecting to get to spend the last hour of the flight in business. Instead, the attendant said ‘I’ve secured you more space, sir, I’m moving your seatmate.’ That’s the only time I’ve flown business class.<br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>

That was a recent and exceptionally unique experience, but honestly the most consistently terrific customer service I get is from Amazon. I think that accessing customer service should be easy to do and theirs is, and quick to resolve issues, and they are! They’ve even fixed things for me when I’ve made the error and that speaks volumes.

                        	<h6>Addressing Q5 </h6>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>My favorite meal to make at home is a simple stir fry with pot stickers– the goal is to use up any vegetable odds and ends in the fridge. I start by assessing the vegetables we have on hand and if we are using chicken or tofu. The ‘constants’ for this dish are Trader Joe’s Soyaki sauce, Trader Joe’s Thai Vegetable Pot stickers and water chestnuts!<br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>First I get my tofu ready –</strong> I cube it and toss in a little bit of toasted sesame oil and garlic then it goes in the oven while I prep the vegetables and cook everything else. The oven makes the tofu nice and crispy on the outside and the cubes don’t fall apart as easily. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Then, I get my veggies ready – </strong>I use whatever is in the fridge, zuchhine, bell peppers, green beans, asparagus, snap peas, mushrooms, bok choy, carrots, celery. I just make sure everything is cut before I get started cooking and I think about which items take longest to cook as I’m cutting.<br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Next, I get two pans nice and hot</strong> (sadly we don’t have an in-counter wok at our house) and put coconut or olive oil in each. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>I put the pot stickers</strong> in the smaller pan, these need around 6 minutes in an open skillet to brown and ‘stick’ so I try not to move them around the pan too much. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>I add the vegetables</strong> to the larger pan in order of cook time (carrots, bok choy, bell peppers first, followed by softer things like green beans, mushrooms and asparagus a few minutes later) <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>To finish up the pot stickers</strong> I add 3 tablespoons of water and put the lid on the skillet so they can steam for the next 4-6 minutes. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>To finish up the stir fry,</strong> I add a few tablespoons of Trader Joe’s Soyaki sauce after shaking it up to mix in the sesame seeds and I finish it with water chestnuts, chopped cashews or chopped green onions. <br/> <p>&nbsp;</p>
I serve the vegetables topped with the oven baked tofu and pot stickers on the side. We eat this once or twice a week at our house.
